            I have been learning to code in 2024. My first programming language I officially learned in school was Java.
            Before I started studying Computer Science I also tried a little bit of Web development but mainly CSS.
            My decision to study Computer Science was pretty impulsively so I didn't do anything before.
            But after starting my degree I realized, it was the right choice for me as I really enjoy Computer Science and coding and am constantly working on getting better.
            There are many ideas that I have and want to put into practise.
            It may take me some time to fulfill them but I still want hang on and do the best to constantly improve my skills.
